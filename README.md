# Metaflow-Gov-Gate-Risk-Scoring
Governance Gate to use with Metaflow, Risk Scoring with Adaptive Oversight
# Metaflow Governance Gate

This package provides a plug-and-play governance gate for Metaflow pipelines, enabling risk scoring with adaptive HITL oversight using minimal code changes. It is designed for production AI/ML workflows where governance must be both robust and efficient.

This pattern ensures that human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval is required only for high-risk scenarios, while low-risk cases proceed automatically.

## Features
-Risk Scoring: Assigns a risk score to each workflow instance based on customizable factors (e.g., prompt content, context, user intent).

-Adaptive Oversight: Triggers human approval only for high-risk cases; low-risk cases proceed automatically.

-Configurable Thresholds: Easily adjust risk scoring logic and approval thresholds.

-Auditability: Logs all risk scores and governance decisions for traceability.

-Timeout & Notification: Optional polling and timeout for human approval.

## Customization Tips
-Risk Factors: Edit score_risk() in governance_gate.py to reflect your use case's risk logic.

-Risk Scoring Logic: Assign a risk score to each workflow instance based on relevant factors, such as content, context, and user intent. Use a 1–5 scale for each factor, then compute an aggregate score.

-Thresholds: Adjust risk_threshold, max_wait, and poll_interval as needed.

-Adaptive Oversight Trigger: If the aggregate risk score meets or exceeds the threshold, the workflow pauses for human review. Otherwise, it proceeds automatically.

-Approval Signal: Integrate with your preferred approval system (e.g., Slack, email, dashboard) by replacing the environment variable check.

## Risk Scoring Table Example
| Factor | Example Value | Score (1–5) |
|------- |-------------- | ----------- |
| Content-Structure| "Transfer $1000..."| 4 |
| Context | Financial transaction |  3 |
| User Intent | Transfer funds | 5 |
|             | Aggregate | 4.0 |

-If aggregate score ≥ 3.5: Human approval required.

-If aggregate score < 3.5: Workflow continues automatically.

## Key Benefits
-Adaptive Oversight: Human review is focused where risk is highest.

-Efficiency: Low-risk cases are not delayed by unnecessary manual gates.

-Auditability: All risk scores and governance decisions are logged for traceability.

-Scalability: The workflow can handle many cases without overwhelming human reviewers.

## Usage

1. Import `GovernanceGate` into your Metaflow step.
2. Instantiate with your prompt/context/intent.
3. Call `.run()` to apply risk scoring and adaptive oversight.
4. Set the `HUMAN_APPROVED` environment variable to approve high-risk steps.

## Example

See `example_flow.py` for a full workflow.
